Zookeeper with Strategy pattern:

We abstract the NoiseBehavior characteristic or feature out from the Animal Interface. This allows the program to choose at runtime depending on the animal type and its specific behavior. Thus, at the object creation of specific animals, the instance of NoiseBehavior is passed on.
