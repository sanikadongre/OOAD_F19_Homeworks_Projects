The implementation focusses on the Zookeeper using basic OOAD inheritance mechanism. The program uses three levels of Inheritance: 
Top level base class: Animal - is the parent class
Mid level: Feline, Canine, Pachyderm- extends Animal Concrete implementations for Animals at the third level - overrides the 
methods in above two classes. Animal class is the topmost level (base class) class will be inherited by child classes - All the properties 
and methods inherited across all the child classes.
